http-share-gui
==============

Graphical desktop version of [http-share](https://github.com/gildean/http-share)

Clone repo, run `npm install` and `./bin/http-share-gui`

The bin currently only supports *NIX, on Windows you need to run `node --harmony app` in the app dir.

This is a WIP, i'll include install-scripts for all systems when i get around to it.
